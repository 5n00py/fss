# FunkyShellSearch (fss) ♫♪♪♫♪♪

FunkyShellSearch (fss) is designed to improve your command-line search
experience. It integrates powerful find and grep utilities like `fd`, `ag` and
`pdfgrep` with the intuitive fzf fuzzy finder. The goal is to create a more
user-friendly and interactive shell-based search environment.

As an ongoing project, FunkyShellSearch will continue to evolve with additional
scripts, features, and documentation, further enriching the file searching and
handling capabilities within the shell environment.

Stay tuned for updates!

## Key Features

- *Versatile Librariees:* At the heart of fss are robust libraries that offer
  easy integration into shell scripts. They enable to construct customized
  shell search commands.
- *Ready-to-Use Scripts:* A suite of sample tools is offered which consists of
  tailor-made scripts for specific file types such as music, videos, images and
  PDFs, providing plug-and-play solutions out of the box.
- *Advanced File Discovery:* Beyond the basic search functionality the scripts
  offer enriched features such as file previews and the ability to directly
  open files with appropriate applications.
- *Configurable Search Operations:* Each script dynamically adapts to various
  file types by loading specific settings from a dedicated configuration file.
  This approach faciliates customization of preview options, file-opening
  commands and other search preferences and requirements.
